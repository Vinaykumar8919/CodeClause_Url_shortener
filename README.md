# CodeClause_Url_shortener
URL shorteners are used to create shortened, more manageable versions of long URLs. They are commonly used in social media posts, email marketing campaigns, and any situation where long URLs are impractical.

Python provides several libraries and frameworks that can be used to build a URL shortening service. One popular choice is Flask, a lightweight web framework.
